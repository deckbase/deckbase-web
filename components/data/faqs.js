    question: "What is Deckbase and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Deckbase is an AI-powered flashcard platform that helps you turn what you read into learning material instantly. Simply capture text from articles, PDFs, books, or notes, and our AI automatically converts it into well-structured flashcards. The app uses spaced repetition to schedule reviews at optimal times, so you don't just collect information—you actually remember it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI generate flashcards?",
    answer:
      "Our AI analyzes your captured text to identify key concepts, definitions, facts, and relationships. It then generates question-answer pairs, adds helpful context and examples, and formats cards in a way that's optimized for long-term memory retention. You can always edit or customize the generated cards to match your learning style.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is spaced repetition and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "Spaced repetition is a scientifically proven learning technique where you review information at increasing intervals over time. Instead of cramming, you review cards right before you're about to forget them. This approach is proven to dramatically improve long-term retention—studies show it can reduce study time by up to 50% while improving recall.",
  },
  {
    question: "What sources can I create flashcards from?",
    answer:
      "Deckbase works with virtually any text source. You can capture content from web articles, PDFs, ebooks, physical books (using your camera), handwritten notes, academic papers, and more. Our share extension makes it easy to send content directly from other apps to Deckbase.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I organize my flashcards into different subjects?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Deckbase lets you organize cards into decks and folders. Create separate decks for different subjects, courses, or topics. You can also add tags to cards for cross-referencing and use smart filters to create focused study sessions based on topics, difficulty, or due date.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much time do I need to study each day?",
    answer:
      "Most users spend just 10-15 minutes per day reviewing their cards. The spaced repetition algorithm prioritizes cards that need attention, so you're always making the most efficient use of your study time. Consistency beats intensity—short daily sessions are more effective than long, infrequent cramming.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I share decks with others?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! You can share your decks with friends, classmates, or study groups. You can also browse and import decks created by the Deckbase community. Shared decks can be customized once imported, so you can adapt them to your specific needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Deckbase work offline?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Deckbase works fully offline. Your cards and study progress are stored on your device, so you can review anywhere—on a plane, in the subway, or anywhere without internet. Progress syncs across devices when you're back online.",
  },
  {
    question: "What subjects work best with Deckbase?",
    answer:
      "Deckbase is versatile and works great for languages, medicine, law, history, science, programming, and any subject that requires memorizing facts, vocabulary, concepts, or procedures. If you need to remember it, Deckbase can help you learn it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a premium version?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Deckbase Premium includes advanced features like unlimited AI card generation, priority processing, advanced analytics, unlimited deck sharing, cloud backup, and cross-device sync. Free users can create cards manually and use basic spaced repetition features.",
